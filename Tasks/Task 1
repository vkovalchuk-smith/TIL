3. Create your first public repository named "TIL" (which stands for "Today I Learned") with the initial README file and Apache 2.0 license.
4. Follow further GitHub instructions to clone your repository locally.
5. Organize your repository's folders structure the way it'd be easy to add and group a new material in the future. Feel free to inspire yourself by looking at how others do it. ;)
